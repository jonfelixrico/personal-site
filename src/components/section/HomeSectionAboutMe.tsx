          While I used to focus more on the back-end, my interests shifted when
          I was introduced to Angular. Since then, my inclination for front-end
          has only snowballed, although I still work on the back-end for my
          personal projects.

          Aside from building websites and applications, I also love to
          integrate technology into my daily life. In fact, I once created an
          automated garden and I'm constantly tinkering with my home network,
          upgrading it with new tech whenever possible. If there's a way to
          automate something, I'll definitely try it out.

          In my free time, I used to be addicted to home brewing coffee, but I
          recently quit because I was consuming at least a liter of coffee per
          day. Now, I'm focused on exploring new ways to integrate tech into my
          life and continuing to learn and grow as a developer.
