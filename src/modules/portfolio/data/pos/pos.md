This point-of-sale (POS) system is a web app intended to digitalize several processes for a client (a small business) to make their workflow easier and more accessible. Some of the processes covered are sales tracking and inventory-keeping.

The end goal here is to create a system which provides the functionality similar to what one can see in supermarkets, such as receipt printer compatibility and barcode-scanning.

This web app is just a few months into development and the first release is still a work in progress. Once the first release ships out, a demo available to the public will be deployed.
