Mockiyomi is a clone of [Tachiyomi](https://tachiyomi.org/), a [manga](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manga) reader app.

The original only had an Android app. There is no app that you can access through the desktop or through iOS devices. This gave me the idea to create a web-app version to support both desktop and iOS devices.

Of course, this is not a full-feature app. This is just for fun so I only took after the feature that intrigued me the most: the actual viewer.

At it's current state, Mockiyomi supports uploading of a PDF file for viewing.
