I have experience with Spring Boot and NestJS, prominent backend frameworks for Java and Node.js respectively, specializing in building RESTful APIs. In addition to crafting APIs, I've worked with relational databases like MySQL and Postgres, as well as NoSQL databases including MongoDB and EventStoreDB. Furthermore, I've utilized several ORMs to streamline database operations in my backend development projects.

Looking ahead, I'm eager to expand my skills beyond Java and JavaScript, exploring technologies and frameworks such as C# (.NET), Ruby (on Rails), and Go. Additionally, I'm excited about the prospect of working on projects that leverage microservices architecture.
