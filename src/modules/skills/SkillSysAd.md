I'm really into self-hosting my projects and services, managing them on my Proxmox cluster. It's where I handle everything from personal projects to services like [streaming](https://jellyfin.org), [gaming](https://pterodactyl.io), and even my own [Internet of Things server](https://www.home-assistant.io). I'm big on security, so tweaking my network setup is a must. I rely use solid enterprise-grade software and hardware everything locked down. Having my own servers and this robust network setup feels like running my own datacenter right from home.

I'm not just all about development nowâ€”diving into this hobby has broadened my skills beyond coding. It's deepened my understanding of infrastructure, networking, and security, making me a more well-rounded developer.
